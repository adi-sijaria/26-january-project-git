            <h1> INDIAN ARMY</h1>
            </br>
            <p> The <mark>Indian Army</mark> is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed
                Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,[4] and its professional head
                is the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with the
                rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The Indian Army
                originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the British Indian Army,
                and the armies of the princely states, which were merged into the national army after independence. The
                units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in several battles
                and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after
                Independence.[5]</p>

                <li>The state of Goa previously fell under Portuguese rule, who refused to abdicate the state even after
                    Indian independence.</li>

                <li>The Indian armed forces, including the Indian army, launched Operation Vijay, a military action
                    which was successful in driving the Portuguese forces off.</li>

                    which was successful in driving the Portuguese forces off.</li>
                <li>Personnel from India were deployed for various peace-keeping missions, including the Korean
                    conflict, while also providing contributions to peace-keeping efforts in Central America, Iran,
                    Yemen, Iraq, Kuwait and others globally.</li>
                <li>India fought the 1971 war on two fronts, the East and West Pakistan, and emerged victorious, which
                    ultimately led to the formation of Bangladesh.</li>
                <li>The 1971 war also saw the largest surrender by armed forces since World War 2 after the Pakistani
                    army surrendered.</li>
